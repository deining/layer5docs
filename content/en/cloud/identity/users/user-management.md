There are three essential aspects of user management:

- Create User
- Add User/ Remove User
- Invite User

## Create User

Seamlessly initiate new user accounts, ensuring a smooth onboarding process. Specify user details, such as email, and tailor their access by adding them to one or more organizations. Optionally assign roles, defining their scope within the platform. Complete the process by sending a personalized account setup email, streamlining the user's introduction to Layer5 Cloud.

## Invite User

An Organization Admin can assign organization roles to users but provider roles can only be assigned by Provider Admins. For more information, see [Roles](/cloud/security/roles).
